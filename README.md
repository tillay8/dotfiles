# Tilley's EndeavourOS Dotfiles :3

My dotfiles I use to start up a new installation of EndeavourOS 

running start.sh as a shell script uses pacman to install all of my favorite packages

running install.sh as a shell script basically moves these files into the config directory and reloads stuff

my waybar is designed to kinda look like the macos bar

macos folder is a bunch of scripts, icon files, and wallpapers to make everything look nice
